# Challenge

**Welcome to the Game Clicker Challenge!**

In this project, you will create a web-based clicker game inspired by "Cookie Clicker."

The objective of the game is to click on an object (it could be a cookie or anything else) to earn points.

With these points, you can purchase items that automate the clicking process for you.

## Acceptance Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge, your game must meet the following requirements:

### Game Structure

1. **Game Initialization**
   - The game must start with a score of 0.

2. **Achievements**
   - After the first 10 clicks, the player should unlock the first achievement.
   - You can add as many achievements as you like, but the first one is mandatory.

3. **Store**
   - There must be a store where players can purchase items.
   - The store must have at least two items available for purchase.
   - The cheapest item in the store should cost 15 points.

### Optional Features

While not mandatory, you are encouraged to implement these optional features to enhance the gameplay:

- **Achievement Notification**
   - Implement a notification system using a Toast component that appears when the player earns their first achievement.

- **Object Customization**
   - Add the ability to modify the appearance of the clicker object. This could involve changing the object's image, color, or animation.

- **Additional Achievements**
   - You can add more achievements to the game to give players more goals to achieve.

- **Expanded Store**
   - Offer more items in the store that players can purchase. These items could have various effects on the clicking rate or provide other benefits.

- **Progress Saving**
   - Implement local storage to save the player's progress. This will allow players to continue from where they left off, even if they close the browser or return to the game later.

## Getting Started

To get started with this challenge, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a new web development project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Create the game interface with the three sections: clicker, achievements, and the store.
3. Implement the clicking mechanism and keep track of the player's score.
4. Design and implement the achievement system.
5. Create the store and add items that can be purchased with points.
6. Optionally, add the notification system, object customization, more achievements, and progress saving using local storage.

Feel free to use any web development tools, frameworks, or libraries you are comfortable with. 
Make sure to create a clear and engaging user experience for your Cookie Clicker game.

Good luck with the challenge, and happy coding!
